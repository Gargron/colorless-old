Ye Olde Colorless Codebase
--------------------------

**Warning: Do not use. Contains bad practices**

This is the second big iteration of the code of theColorless.net (the first one being written from scratch without using any frameworks). This one is using a (dated) version of the CodeIgniter framework. It is published merely for history and curiousity, and should not be used as an example, as this is generally pretty bad code.

The main felonies of this codebase are:

* No clear separation of data storage and application logic
* Wrong usage of OOP principles - models do not represent objects
* Bad usage of the MVC pattern - no good model-controller logic separation
* Unorganized views
